    <p>So as you may have gathered by now, my name is Jeremy Johnson. I am 
        currently a student at Scottsdale Community College, studying towards a 
        degree in Computer Science. Next year I plan to attend Arizona State University 
        as part of their Ira Fulton School of Engineering, pursuing my 
        Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis in software 
        engineering. </P> 
    
    <p>I built this page due to the realization that:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>a) I remember nothing of the HTML/CSS I learned a few years back</li>
            <li>b) I have zero professional online presence, outside of my sales oriented LinkedIn page</li>
            <li>c) My school projects are not the most challenging</li>

        </ol>
        <p>If you've read this far, it's only fair to give you a little about me.
        In 2011 I graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelors of Arts 
        in Marketing. I went straight from school to working in technology related sales. 
        Over the next 4 years I worked in both inside and outside sales, typically
        working to create tech solutions for client problems. </p>  
        
        <p>While I was making a comfortable living, I realized I was more passionate  
        bout learning the technology I worked sold, than selling it. Around this 
        time I began teaching myself the basics of coding. After several months 
        of doing this off and on, I made the decision to leave a career in sales,
        and pursue a degree in Computer Science.</P>
